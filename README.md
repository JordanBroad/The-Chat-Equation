# The Chat Equation

This repository hosts the data artefacts and reproducibility materials for the paper:

**Jordan Broad (2026). _The Chat Equation: Modeling the Emergence and Ontological Divergence of Synthetic Intelligence_.**

The core paper introduces the **Chat Equation**, a compact framework for reasoning about (i) biological incidence, (ii) threshold traversal into general synthetic intelligence, (iii) alignment probability, and (iv) post-threshold amplification via **E = E_r · E_s · E_e**. The repository provides the underlying grid/simulation outputs and supporting files used to generate Appendix figures and summary tables.

## Repository contents

Recommended structure:

- `paper/` — manuscript files (DOCX/PDF)
- `data/` — tabular and structured datasets (CSV/NPZ/JSON)
- `figures/` — exported figure files (PNG/SVG)
- `code/` — scripts/notebooks used to generate figures and tables

If you have uploaded files to the repository root, consider moving them into the above folders to make the repository self-describing.

## Reproducibility note

The results are generated by repeatable computations. A Python script performs parameter sweeps and Monte Carlo sampling; a large language model may assist as an editorial/programming aide (drafting, checking, and explaining code and captions), but it does not supply data or decide outcomes.

## Data artefacts

Appendix C (parameter grid / regime map):

- `AppendixC_heatmap_dataset.csv` — long-form dataset for plotting (A, log10(E), S, label, delta)
- `AppendixC_alignment_emergence_grid_delta0p05.csv` — full grid output (versioned by delta)
- `AppendixC_alignment_emergence_grid_delta0p05_meta.json` — metadata (delta, axes, generation parameters)
- `AppendixC_alignment_emergence_grid_delta0p05.npz` — structured array export for downstream analysis
- `AppendixC_heatmap_aligned_share_delta0p05.png` — aligned share heatmap export (if included)
- `AppendixC_regime_map_S_ge_0p5_delta0p05.png` — binary regime map export (if included)

Appendix D (Monte Carlo summary):

- `AppendixD_monte_carlo_summary_tightened.csv` — scenario summary table (log10 percentiles; P(Cm > Ca))
- `AppendixD_monte_carlo_summary_table.png` — rendered table figure
